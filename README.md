# Console-Finances

## Project
This project entailed using concepts of foundational Javascript learnt. Utilising arrays, loops etc.. to createcode for analysing the financial records of a company.

## Acceptable Criteria
The task as mentioned before was to write Javascript code that examines the financial records of a company. We were given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

With this code we had to calculate the following:-

1. The total number of months included in the dataset.
2. The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
3. The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period (tracking what the total change in the profits are from month to month and then finding the average of that).
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

## Outcome
This project was very challenging as I am very new to Javascript, however with a lot of help I was able to achieve everything set out in the acceptable criteria, and they are:-

1. I was able to find the total number of months included in the dataset

2. And then progress to finding out the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

3. The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period, was found.

4. Lastly, I was able to find the greatest 'Increase' and greates 'Decrease' in profits and losses over the entire period.
